title: What are the SMS and Email Fields during the payment flow?
---
Ezetap enables merchants collect digital receipts on Android devices. The receipts can then be sent to the customer as proof of payment via SMS or Email. Once the payment transaction is successful, the agent can enter the customer's SMS and/or Email and send the payment receipt. On Windows platform, the same functionality is provided without the ability to capture signature.
