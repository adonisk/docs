title: How do I obtain cardholder's signature for credit/debit card transactions?
---
It is mandatory to take a cardholder's signature for credit/debit card payments. The card holder will have to sign on the mobile device after the transaction has been authorized by the issuer. For some PIN based card's, signature is optional. In such instances, the application will not ask for the customer's signature.
