title: What is a Refund
---

Refund functionality is extended to a superuser role wherein the user can refund the customer after a transaction is settled. For Debit cards, since the transaction settlement is instant, a refund can be initiated anytime. On a credit card transaction, since the settlement occurs at end of day, a refund can only be initiated the following day.
